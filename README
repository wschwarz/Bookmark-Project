Description:
  This project arose from a personal need for better organization of my current 
and future bookmarks as well as the desire to try out new developmental tools 
(primarily learning how to build Chrome extensions and using Mongo DB). This 
application is relient on a user utilizing the corresponding chrome extension
(located http://github.com/wschwarz/BookmarkChromeExtension). Current development
is in PHP but a possible rewrite in ROR is being considerd (to learn a new language).
The feature list is subject to change based on development time available and 
each feature's priority.

In Progress
